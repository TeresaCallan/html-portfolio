<h1>The Best Movies According to Teresa</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all time...</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Dune</h3>
<p>This movie is a cinamatic wonder. If you like well shot cinamatography and tense sci-fi drama - there isn't another movie that competes.</p>
<h3>Terminator 2</h3>
<p>This classic future dystopia gave the world fantastic action scenes, amazing new special effects, intelligent character evolution, and some iconic quotes: 
   <br /> <br /> Hasta la vista, baby ; >
   <br /> <br /> I'll be back .
   <br /> <br /> No problemo !

<h3>Finding Nemo</h3>
<p>The best of Pixar screenwriting adventure ! Who doesn't want to live life under the sea just like Nemo?</p>
